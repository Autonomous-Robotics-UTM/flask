# Flask Server

Uses Dash for graphing and Flask for hosting the server

## Graphing

The server is capable of:

* Plotting a live graph of the car's joystick controls over time while it is running with the ability to:
    * Reset the graph but keep data intact as it plots
    * See the last n values on the graph for clearer data
    * Upload csv files onto the live graph for comparison
    * Pause the live graph as its graphing to look at any data
* Saves that graph as a csv in a folder called csv
* Second graph available for looking at any of the past live graphs that have happened
    * Graphs are labeled by the time they were plotted
